# Practical Machine Learning with Python
### A Problem-Solver's Guide to Building Real-World Intelligent Systems

*"Data is the new oil"* is a saying which you must have heard by now along with the huge interest building up around Big Data and Machine Learning in the recent past along with Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. Besides this, data scientists have been termed as having *"The sexiest job in the 21st Century"* which makes it all the more worthwhile to build up some valuable expertise in these areas. Getting started with machine learning in the real world can be overwhelming with the vast amount of resources out there on the web.

[*__"Practical Machine Learning with Python"__*](https://github.com/dipanjanS/practical-machine-learning-with-python#contents)  follows a structured and comprehensive three-tiered approach packed with concepts, methodologies, hands-on examples, and code. This book is packed with over 500 pages of useful information which helps its readers master the essential skills needed to recognize and solve complex problems with Machine Learning and Deep Learning by following a data-driven mindset. By using real-world case studies that leverage the popular Python Machine Learning ecosystem, this book is your perfect companion for learning the art and science of Machine Learning to become a successful practitioner. The concepts, techniques, tools, frameworks, and methodologies used in this book will teach you how to think, design, build, and execute Machine Learning systems and projects successfully.

Master the essential skills needed to recognize and solve complex problems with machine learning and deep learning. Using real-world examples that leverage the popular Python machine learning ecosystem, this book is your perfect companion for learning the art and science of machine learning to become a successful practitioner. The concepts, techniques, tools, frameworks, and methodologies used in this book will teach you how to think, design, build, and execute machine learning systems and projects successfully. 

We will focus on leveraging the latest state-of-the-art data analysis, machine learning and deep learning frameworks including [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [`statsmodels`](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), [`spaCy`](https://spacy.io/), [`nltk`](http://www.nltk.org/), [`gensim`](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), [`tensorflow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [`keras`](https://keras.io/) besides several others to process, wrangle, analyze, visualize and model on real-world datasets and problems! With a learn-by-doing approach, we try to abstract out complex theory and concepts (while presenting the essentials wherever necessary), which often tends to hold back practitioners from leveraging the true power of machine learning to solve their own problems.
